Hi IT Team,

Thanks for granting the app permission - that worked!

I tested the connection and found one more issue: my user account has "Limited Control" permission which blocks the app from accessing the Training_Progress list.

## What I Need

Please upgrade my account permission from "Limited Control" to "Edit" on the FLTOPS-TRAINING site.

**User Account:** mohamadshazreen.sazali@malaysiaairlines.com
**Site:** https://mabitdept.sharepoint.com/sites/FLTOPS-TRAINING
**Current Permission:** Limited Control
**Required Permission:** Edit (or Contribute)

## Can You Do This?

Are you able to upgrade user permissions on the FLTOPS-TRAINING site, or do we need to contact the site owner/administrator?

If you can do this, here's how:

1. Go to: https://mabitdept.sharepoint.com/sites/FLTOPS-TRAINING
2. Click Settings (gear icon) → Site permissions
3. Find: mohamadshazreen.sazali@malaysiaairlines.com
4. Change permission from "Limited Control" to "Edit"

**If you cannot do this:** Please let me know who I should contact (site owner or site collection admin).

Once this is done, the app will be ready to use.

Thanks!
